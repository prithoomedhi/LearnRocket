# Learn Rocket

A codebase for me to learn [Rocket](https://rocket.rs), a micro-web-framework for [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

"_Rocket is a web framework for Rust. If you'd like, you can think of Rocket as being a more flexible, friendly medley of Rails, Flask, Bottle, and Yesod. We prefer to think of Rocket as something new. Rocket aims to be fast, easy, and flexible while offering guaranteed safety and security where it can. Importantly, Rocket also aims to be fun, and it accomplishes this by ensuring that you write as little code as needed to accomplish your task._

_This guide introduces you to the core, intermediate, and advanced concepts of Rocket. After reading this guide, you should find yourself being very productive with Rocket._"[^1]
